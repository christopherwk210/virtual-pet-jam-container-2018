# Virtual Pet Container
An electron container for our virtual pet jam entry, "Bin Monster". The actual game is made in GMS2, this is an application container built to accept features not supported by GMS2:

- File dropping
- Frameless transparent window
- Cross platform support with only the HTML5 module ;)

See source of actual game [here](https://github.com/AndrewBGM/virtual-pet-jam-2018).
